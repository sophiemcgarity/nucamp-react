# NuCamp React

## Description
This project was built as part of the [NuCamp](https://www.nucamp.co/) coding boot camp.  This was my first React project with the main production goal for me to learn React, Redux and hosting via JSON server. The aim was to produce a website for a campground company to hold information on each of their campsites. 

## Viewing the project
As this project using a JSON server only the static content on the pages is available to view [here](https://sophiemcgarity.github.io/home).



## Futher Developments 
- Host via a detecated hosting plaform
- Merge with my [back-end](https://github.com/sophiemcgarity/nucamp-NodeJS-Express-MongoDB) Node.js, Express and MongoDB project to build a scable back-end

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
